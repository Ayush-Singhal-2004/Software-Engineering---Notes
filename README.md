<h1>Unit 1</h1>
<h3>1. What is Software Engineering?</h3>
- Software Engineering consists of two words software and engineering, where Software can be defined as a collection of computer programs, which in turn is a collection of commands. Engineering on the other hand, is all about developing products, using well-defined, scientific principles and methods.</br>
- Software Engineering is a systemic, well disciplined ,cost effective techniques for software development. The outcome of software engineering is an efficient and reliable software product</br>

<h3>2. What is Agile Process?</h3>
- Agile means changes, & to adapt those changes. Agile is a project management methodology that breaks down larger projects into smaller, manageable chunks known as iterations. At the end of every iteration something of value is produced. The product thatâ€™s produced during every iteration should be able to be placed into the world to receive feedback from stakeholders or users.</br>
- Phases of Agile Process :</br>
i. Requirement gathering and analysis </br>
ii. Design the requirements</br>
iii. Construction/ iteration</br>
iv. Deployment</br>
v. Testing</br>
vi. Feedback</br>
- Advantages :</br>
i. Project is divided into short and transparent iterations.</br>
ii. It minimizes the risk of software development.</br>
iii. Quick release of the first product version.</br>
iv. Customer can see the result and understand whether he/she is satisfied with it or not.</br>
v. It has a flexible change process.</br>
- Disadvantages :</br>
i. The development team should be highly professional and client-oriented.</br>
ii. New requirement may be a conflict with the existing architecture.</br>
iii. With further correction and change, there may be chances that the project will cross the expected time.</br>
iv. There may be difficult to estimate the final cost of the project due to constant iteration.</br>
