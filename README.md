#Unit 1
1. What is Software Engineering?
- Software Engineering consists  of two words software and engineering, where Software can be defined as a collection of computer programs, which in turn is a collection of commands. Engineering on the other hand, is all about developing products, using well-defined, scientific principles and methods. 
- Software Engineering is a systemic, well disciplined ,cost effective techniques for software development. The outcome of software engineering is an efficient and reliable software product

2. What is Agile Process?
- Agile means changes, & to adapt those changes. Agile is a project management methodology that breaks down larger projects into smaller, manageable chunks known as iterations. At the end of every iteration something of value is produced. The product thatâ€™s produced during every iteration should be able to be placed into the world to receive feedback from stakeholders or users.
- Phases of Agile Process :
i. Requirement gathering and analysis
ii. Design the requirements
iii. Construction/ iteration
iv. Deployment
v. Testing
vi. Feedback
- Advantages :
i. Project is divided into short and transparent iterations.
ii. It minimizes the risk of software development.
iii. Quick release of the first product version.
iv. Customer can see the result and understand whether he/she is satisfied with it or not.
v. It has a flexible change process.
- Disadvantages :
i. The development team should be highly professional and client-oriented.
ii. New requirement may be a conflict with the existing architecture.
iii. With further correction and change, there may be chances that the project will cross the expected time.
iv. There may be difficult to estimate the final cost of the project due to constant iteration.
